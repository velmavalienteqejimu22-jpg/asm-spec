# Agent Service Manifest (ASM)

> **OpenAPI describes what a service *can do*. ASM describes what a service *is worth*.**

ASM is an open protocol that gives AI agents structured, machine-readable data to **evaluate, compare, and automatically select** AI services — covering pricing, quality, SLA, and payment.

```
MCP  → "what a tool can do"          ✅ Solved (Anthropic)
A2A  → "how agents communicate"      ✅ Solved (Google)
AP2  → "how to pay safely"           ✅ Solved (Google)
ASM  → "what a service is worth"     ❌ Nobody — until now
```

**ASM is the missing layer between MCP and AP2.**

---

## Why ASM?

When an agent faces multiple services that can fulfill the same task, it has **zero structured data** to choose:

| Without ASM | With ASM |
|---|---|
| Blind selection (pick cheapest or most famous) | Structured multi-criteria matching |
| 3-10x cost overrun or quality underrun | Optimal cost-quality tradeoff |
| Decisions are non-reproducible | Deterministic, auditable, explainable |
| Model intelligence = 0 at selection step | Full autonomous decision capability |

**This is not a model intelligence problem — it's a data problem.** No matter how smart the model, unstructured pricing pages are uncomputable.

## Quick Start

### Run the Demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asm-protocol/asm-spec.git
cd asm-spec

# End-to-end demo — pure Python, no dependencies
python3 demo/e2e_demo.py
```

The demo simulates 5 scenarios where an agent selects services across LLM, image generation, video generation, and TTS categories.

### Run the Scorer

```bash
python3 scorer/scorer.py
```

### Start the MCP Server

```bash
cd registry
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

The MCP server exposes 5 tools: `asm_list`, `asm_get`, `asm_query`, `asm_compare`, `asm_score`.

---

## How It Works

### 1. A service publishes an ASM manifest

```json
{
  "asm_version": "0.2",
  "service_id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4@4.0",
  "taxonomy": "ai.llm.chat",
  "display_name": "Claude Sonnet 4",
  "pricing": {
    "billing_dimensions": [
      { "dimension": "input_token",  "unit": "per_1M", "cost_per_unit": 3.00,  "currency": "USD" },
      { "dimension": "output_token", "unit": "per_1M", "cost_per_unit": 15.00, "currency": "USD" }
    ],
    "batch_discount": 0.5
  },
  "quality": {
    "metrics": [{
      "name": "LMSYS_Elo", "score": 1290, "scale": "Elo",
      "benchmark": "LMSYS Chatbot Arena",
      "self_reported": false
    }]
  },
  "sla": {
    "latency_p50": "800ms", "uptime": 0.999,
    "rate_limit": "4000 req/min"
  }
}
```

### 2. An agent queries and scores

```python
from scorer import select_service, Constraints, Preferences

results = select_service(
    manifests,
    constraints=Constraints(min_quality=0.7, max_latency_s=5.0),
    preferences=Preferences(cost=0.5, quality=0.3, speed=0.15, reliability=0.05),
    method="topsis",
)

print(results[0].service.display_name)  # "GPT-4o"
print(results[0].reasoning)             # "GPT-4o scored 0.914 ..."
```

### 3. The full pipeline

```
Agent receives task
    │
    ▼
Task → Taxonomy mapping
    "subtitles" → ai.video.subtitle
    │
    ▼
ASM Registry Query
    GET .well-known/asm?taxonomy=ai.video.subtitle
    → Returns matching service manifests
    │
    ▼
ASM Scorer
    Filter (hard constraints) → TOPSIS (multi-criteria ranking)
    → Ranked list + reasoning
    │
    ▼
Selection + Execution
    Agent calls selected service via MCP
    AP2 handles payment
    Signed Receipt verifies delivery
```

## Schema (v0.2)

ASM manifests are JSON documents with **only 3 required fields**:

```json
{
  "asm_version": "0.2",
  "service_id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4@4.0",
  "taxonomy": "ai.llm.chat"
}
```

Everything else is optional — services expose what they can:

| Module | What it describes | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| **pricing** | Cost structure | `billing_dimensions` (12 types), `tiers`, `conditions`, `batch_discount` |
| **quality** | Performance metrics | `metrics` (benchmark + `self_reported` flag), `leaderboard_rank` |
| **sla** | Reliability | `latency_p50/p99`, `uptime`, `rate_limit`, `cold_start`, `regions` |
| **payment** | How to pay | `methods`, `auth_type`, `ap2_endpoint` |
| **extensions** | Category-specific | Namespaced fields (e.g., `llm.supports_vision`, `image_gen.max_resolution`) |

Full schema: [`schema/asm-v0.2.schema.json`](schema/asm-v0.2.schema.json)

### Taxonomy (18 categories)

Hierarchical, prefix-queryable (e.g., `ai.llm.*` returns all LLM services):

```
ai.llm.chat                     ai.audio.tts
ai.llm.completion                ai.audio.stt
ai.llm.embedding                 ai.audio.music
ai.vision.image_generation       ai.code.generation
ai.vision.image_editing          ai.data.extraction
ai.vision.ocr                    ai.data.search
ai.video.generation              infra.compute.gpu
ai.video.subtitle                infra.storage.object
ai.video.editing                 infra.storage.vector
```

---

## Scorer

Two scoring methods:

**Weighted Average** — simple, transparent, demo-ready.

**TOPSIS** — multi-criteria decision making that considers distance to both ideal and worst solutions. More robust against extreme values.

Both support:
- **Hard constraints** (filter): `quality >= 0.8 AND latency <= 5s`
- **Soft preferences** (rank): `cost=0.4, quality=0.35, speed=0.15, reliability=0.10`

---

## MCP Server

The `asm-registry` MCP server provides 5 tools:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `asm_list` | List all services in the registry |
| `asm_get` | Get full manifest for a specific service |
| `asm_query` | Filter by taxonomy, cost, quality, latency, modality |
| `asm_compare` | Side-by-side comparison of 2-5 services |
| `asm_score` | Score and rank with custom preference weights |

### Configure in Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "asm-registry": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/asm-spec/registry/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Trust Model

ASM implements a 3-layer trust architecture:

```
L1: self_reported flag          → Agent knows "who says this"
L2: Third-party benchmarks      → Independently verifiable scores
L3: Signed Receipts (post-hoc)  → ASM declares → Receipt proves → Trust updates
```

### L1: Transparency at the Source

Every quality metric carries a `self_reported` boolean. An agent can distinguish a vendor's own claim (`self_reported: true`) from an independent benchmark result (`self_reported: false`).

### L2: External Verification

Quality metrics reference public benchmarks with URLs, evaluation dates, and leaderboard positions — all independently checkable.

### L3: Signed Receipts Integration

ASM manifests declare expected service quality *before* execution. [Signed Receipts](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-farley-acta-signed-receipts/) (IETF ACTA) prove what *actually* happened after execution. The combination enables **computable trust**:

```
trust_delta(service, metric) = |declared_value - actual_value| / declared_value
```

If a manifest declares `latency_p50: 200ms` but receipts consistently record 450ms, the trust delta is 1.25 — a quantifiable, verifiable credibility signal. No other protocol stack provides this.

The `asm:` namespace is registered for receipt type fields:
- `asm:service_selection` — records which service was chosen, from which candidate pool, and why
- Receipt payloads carry `service_id` and `taxonomy` from the manifest for full traceability

Integration status: active collaboration with the [Agent Receipts](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/agent-receipts) team. Schema v0.3 will add `receipt_endpoint`, `verification.protocol`, and `verification.public_key` fields.

---

## Design Principles

1. **MCP-compatible** — can embed as `x-asm` annotations in ToolAnnotations
2. **Minimal required fields** — only `asm_version`, `service_id`, `taxonomy`
3. **Multi-dimensional pricing** — `billing_dimensions` array (LLM has input + output tokens)
4. **Trust transparency** — `self_reported` flag distinguishes self-assessed vs third-party verified
5. **Extensions don't pollute core** — category-specific fields in `extensions` namespace
6. **Declaration, not execution** — ASM declares value, AP2 executes payment

---

## Integration Path

| Phase | How | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Independent `.well-known/asm` endpoint | Current |
| Phase 2 | `x-asm` embedded in MCP ToolAnnotations | After SEP |
| Phase 3 | Native MCP core fields | Long-term |
